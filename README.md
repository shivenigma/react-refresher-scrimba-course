## Tutorial challenges app
- This is not one single app in a meaningful way.
- I am following along with some tutorials and trying stuff out with react.
- Instead of creating different apps for each challenge and pollute my Github, I instead add them as different routes.
- I try to arrange components used for each challenge under components inside a directory, but not sure how much flexibility react has here.
- The code though is, 100% handwritten without any help from AI overlords.
